- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lord-Asen
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and full stack development.
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing data science course at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore,Tamil Nadu,India. Other than data science I have been learning full stack development, blender and other programming languages such as C, R and Java.
- 💞️ I'm passionate about web development, data science, and Blender! 🌐💻📊 Let's join forces and create extraordinary projects. Whether it's crafting dynamic websites, exploring data insights, or diving into the world of 3D with Blender, I'm ready for collaboration. Feel free to connect if you have exciting opportunities or innovative ideas! 🚀
